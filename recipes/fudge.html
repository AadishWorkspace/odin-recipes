        <h4>Description:</h4>
        Fudge is a rich and creamy confectionary treat that's beloved for its smooth texture and sweet flavor.<br>
        It's typically made by boiling sugar, butter, and milk or cream to a soft-ball stage, then cooled and beaten to achieve its characteristic smoothness.<br>
        Fudge can be customized with various flavors like chocolate, vanilla, peanut butter, and even fruit or nut additions.<br>
        It's often cut into squares or rectangles for serving, making it a popular choice for homemade gifts, holiday treats, or indulgent desserts.<br>
